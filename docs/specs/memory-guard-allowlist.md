# Memory-guard allowlist

Every place in the tree that still reaches memory **without** going through
`MemoryGuard`, and why. Produced by M4b; consumed by M4c.

Pinned by the ratchet in `src/openhuman/memory/bypass_allowlist_tests.rs`
(M4c), which fails **both ways** — when a new unguarded call site appears
(`no_new_memory_driver_bypasses`), and when an allowlisted one is cleaned up
without being struck from the list (`bypass_allowlist_has_no_stale_entries`).
Two further tests stop the lint rotting into a rubber stamp: the scanner must
find a known bypass, and every needle must still match something.

M4b shipped a provisional, file-keyed version of this guard inside
`memory/ops/guard_tests.rs`. M4c deleted it — two allowlists over one tree must
both be struck on every cleanup, and the one nobody remembers is exactly the
dead-string rot the ratchet exists to prevent.

## Scope

The lint scans `src/` for thirteen patterns, keyed on `(file, pattern)` so the
failure message names the needle that tripped:

| Pattern | What it hands out |
| --- | --- |
| `active_memory_client(` | `MemoryClientRef` |
| `global::client_if_ready(` / `global::client(` | `MemoryClientRef` |
| `.memory_handle(` | raw `Arc<dyn Memory>` |
| `.profile_conn(` | raw `Arc<Mutex<rusqlite::Connection>>` (one in-family site) |
| `.profile_store(` | a typed `ProfileStore` — confined, but still unguarded |
| `.get_document(` | `pub(crate)` read-one escape hatch |
| `EmbeddedMemoryProvider::new(` / `NullMemoryProvider::new(` | a driver, built outside `binding::for_workspace` |
| `MemoryClient::from_workspace_dir(` | a second engine on the same store |
| `binding::for_workspace(` / `.memory_binding(` | a raw `MemoryBinding` |
| `.unguarded_provider(` | the raw `Arc<dyn MemoryProvider>` off a `MemoryBinding` |

**By-path test files (`*_tests.rs`, `tests.rs`, `test_support/`) are out of
scope.** Driver tests construct drivers — that is what a driver test *is* —
so allowlisting them would add ~25 entries that can never shrink and would
churn on every new test. Inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks are *not*
stripped, because brace-tracking Rust with a line scanner is fragile and
getting it wrong silently hides production sites; the three files affected are
allowlisted with a reason saying so. Comment lines are skipped, so doc-comment
references are not mistaken for calls.

`global::init(workspace)` is deliberately **not** scanned. It binds the
workspace; it does not read or write memory, and every call site is a
login / active-user-switch / boot / CLI-entry lifecycle event
(`security/credentials/ops.rs`, `desktop/app_state/ops.rs`,
`core/runtime/context.rs`, `core/memory_cli.rs`, `core/subconscious_cli.rs`,
`bin/slack_backfill.rs`, `bin/gmail_backfill_3d.rs`,
`memory/ops/documents.rs`'s `memory_init`, `memory/tinycortex/sync.rs`).

## What M4b re-pointed

Four RPC handlers, all in `src/openhuman/memory/ops/`, each of whose contract
twin is a literal one-line delegation to the same host method on the same
store:

| Handler | Contract method | Driver body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `documents::doc_put` | `MemoryDocuments::put_document` | `client.put_doc(input)` |
| `kv_graph::kv_set` | `MemoryGraph::kv_put` | `client.kv_set(ns, key, &value)` |
| `tool_memory::tool_rule_list` | `MemoryToolMemory::tool_rules` | `tool_memory_store(memory).list_rules(tool)` |
| `tool_memory::tool_rule_delete` | `MemoryToolMemory::delete_tool_rule` | `tool_memory_store(memory).delete_rule(tool, id)` |

**Three deltas ride along, and they are the point of the milestone, not
accidents:**

1. **Tier enforcement.** A write now goes through `ToolOperation::Act`, so a
   `readonly` autonomy tier refuses it and the hourly action budget is charged
   one unit. Reads take `ToolOperation::Read`, which `SecurityPolicy` answers
   `Ok` for unconditionally today.
2. **Error strings gain a method prefix.** The driver wraps host failures
   through `host_error(context, error)`, so `"<orig>"` becomes
   `"put_document: <orig>"`. Additive context, never a swallowed cause.
3. **Taint may be raised.** `doc_put` still passes `MemoryTaint::Internal`; the
   guard's `stamp_taint` promotes it to `ExternalSync` when the turn runs under
   a source scope. It can never launder the other direction.

Redaction is a byte-identical pass-through for an embedded driver, and the
ambient source scope is applied only on `MemoryTree::query_source`, so neither
changes anything here.

## The allowlist

### A. Legitimate residents — the driver, the seam, the bind site

| Path | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `memory/driver/embedded/mod.rs` | This **is** the driver. Guarding it would be a cycle. |
| `memory/driver/embedded/tool_memory_tests.rs` | Driver tests. |
| `memory/tinycortex/sync.rs` | The engine seam. |
| `memory/global.rs` | The process-global slot itself. |
| `memory/ops/helpers.rs` | Defines `active_memory_client`. |
| `memory/ops/guard.rs`, `guard_tests.rs` | The guarded resolver; matches only in prose and in its own fallback. |
| `memory/ops/provider.rs` (`.unguarded_provider(`) | Health probe on the bound driver; a liveness probe is not product code. |
| `core/cli_capability.rs` (`binding::for_workspace(`) | The CLI's capability gate (`kernel.md` §3.3's one exception to "degradation is absence"). Reads the driver id and advertised capability set only — the same two values `memory.provider_status` already returns over RPC — and never reaches memory content. No CLI subcommand except `run`/`serve` builds a `CoreContext`, so `CoreContext::memory()` resolves to nothing and there is no guard to route through. `core/memory_cli.rs` calls `bound_memory_driver_for` rather than binding itself. |
| `core/subsystems_cli.rs` | The `openhuman subsystems` slot table. Delegates to `memory_subsystem_status` (which itself resolves the binding in `memory/ops/provider.rs`, already allowlisted above), so `subsystems_cli.rs` never touches `binding::for_workspace(` directly — the CLI's command arms go through `bound_memory_driver_for`. |

### B. Profile / facet access — confined, still unguarded

`MemoryClient::profile_conn()` used to hand a raw
`Arc<Mutex<rusqlite::Connection>>` to three domains outside the memory family,
two of which wrote SQL inline at the call site. It is now
`pub(in crate::openhuman::memory)` with a single caller — `profile_store()`,
which wraps it in a typed `ProfileStore` (`memory/store/profile_store.rs`). Every
SQL statement against `user_profile` is inside the memory family, and the
compiler enforces that; `client_tests.rs::profile_conn_is_confined_to_the_memory_family`
restates the rule in a form that names the offending file.

**That is confinement, not policy.** The contract has no profile/facet
capability family, so these reads and writes still run beneath all seven steps —
no tier check, no source scope, no taint, no redaction, no budget, no audit
event. **This is why "the guard is the only path" is still not a true
invariant.** Closing it needs a fourteenth family in `tinycortex_api`, or a
host-side half-measure where `ProfileStore` consults `GuardPolicy` directly —
which would make a `readonly` tier start rejecting learning-cache rebuilds and
composio identity persistence, a behaviour change with its own blast radius.

The `.profile_store(` needle exists so the count does not vanish by rename: the
number of unguarded profile call sites did not drop, only their shape changed.

| Path | Pattern | Sites |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `memory/store/client.rs` | `.profile_conn(` | 1 (the wrap site) |
| `memory/sync/composio/providers/profile.rs` | `.profile_store(` | 4 |
| `agent/learning/schemas.rs` | `.profile_store(` | 3 |
| `agent/learning/tools.rs` | `.profile_store(` | 1 |
| `agent/learning/startup.rs` | `.profile_store(` | 2 |

A second write path into `user_profile` is **not** covered by either needle:
`agent/harness/archivist/lifecycle.rs` calls `profile::profile_upsert` on a
connection injected at construction. It has no production construction site
today (only `archivist_tests.rs` and `test_constructors.rs` build one), so it is
inert — but it is a fresh unlinted write path the moment anyone wires it up.

### C. Needs a concrete engine type the contract does not expose

| Path | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `agent/experience/ops.rs` | `AgentExperienceStore::new` takes `Arc<dyn Memory>`; the non-`"memory"` subdir branch also builds `UnifiedMemory::new_with_memory_dir` directly — a per-profile store the binding has no concept of. |
| `agent/harness/session/builder/factory.rs` | `.memory_handle()` → `Arc<dyn Memory>`. |
| `flows/tinyflows/memory_adapter.rs` | Returns `Arc<dyn Memory>` to satisfy a tinyflows engine trait. The contract has no `Arc<dyn Memory>` door. |
| `flows/bus.rs` | `resolve_memory() -> Option<Arc<dyn Memory>>`, and carries a `#[cfg(test)] memory_override` seam a guard would bypass. |
| `memory/tool_memory/tools/list.rs`, `tools/put.rs` | Agent tools building `ToolMemoryStore` from `memory_handle()`. Re-pointable in principle via `as_tool_memory()` — **deferred to M5**, which filters the tool surface by capability and would collide with a re-point made now. |
| `memory/ops/tool_memory.rs` (`open_store`) | Still needed by the four handlers left on the client. Shrank; did not disappear. |

### D. No contract method exists, or the wire shape would change

| Path | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `memory/ops/documents.rs` — `namespace_list`, `doc_ingest`, `doc_list`, `doc_delete`, `clear_namespace`, `context_query`, `context_recall`, `memory_*` | Each answers with a `serde_json::Value` / `String` shape with no typed contract twin; `clear_namespace` has no contract method at all; `memory_query_namespace` depends on `query_limit_for_request(client: &MemoryClient, …)`. |
| `memory/ops/kv_graph.rs` — `kv_get`, `kv_delete`, `kv_list_namespace`, `graph_upsert`, `graph_query` | `kv_get` is an O(slice) scan in the driver and returns `MemoryKvRecord`, not `Value`; `kv_delete` has **no** contract method; `graph_query`'s camelCase→typed conversion is documented as new and lossy. |
| `memory/ops/tool_memory.rs` — `tool_rule_put`, `tool_rule_get`, `tool_rules_json`, `tool_rules_for_prompt` | `put_tool_rule` returns unit while the RPC returns the stored rule with a refreshed `updated_at`; the other three have no contract equivalent. |
| `memory/ops/sync.rs` | `client.ingestion_state().snapshot()` — queue telemetry, absent from the contract. |
| `memory/ops/learn.rs` | `list_namespaces() -> Vec<String>` vs the contract's `Vec<NamespaceSummary>`, then heavy engine work. |
| `flows/ops.rs` | `clear_namespace` (no contract method) plus a `memory_client_override` test seam. |
| `integrations/composio/schemas.rs` | Passes `&MemoryClientRef` into `user_scopes::save`. |
| `memory/sync/composio/providers/user_scopes.rs`, `types.rs` | Same `&MemoryClientRef` parameter shape. |

### E. Tests

`flows/ops_tests.rs`, `flows/tinyflows/memory_node_e2e_tests.rs`,
`integrations/composio/ops_tests.rs`, `core/runtime/context.rs` (its `#[cfg(test)]`
module).

## Honest scorecard

Four of the twenty-eight `active_memory_client()` call sites now route through
the guard. Raw `profile_conn()` no longer leaves the memory family — but the ten
profile/facet call sites it fed are still unguarded, now through a typed
`ProfileStore`, and twelve non-test `memory_handle()` sites still hand out raw
handles. The defensible claim is therefore:

> Every memory RPC handler whose contract twin is a literal delegation now
> routes through the guard, and every remaining bypass is enumerated here with
> a reason and pinned by a drift guard.

"Impossible to skip by construction" is **not** true until `memory_handle()`
is gone and the profile/facet tables have a capability family to be guarded
against.
