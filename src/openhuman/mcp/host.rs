//! The `tinymcp` service this process holds, and the conversion into it.
//!
//! The MCP client lives in `tinymcp` now. What is left here is the host half:
//! this holder, the RPC surface over it, the agent-facing tools, and the
//! prompt-injection scan over remote tool definitions.
//!
//! # Why a holder exists at all
//!
//! Before the extraction the connection map, the pending-authorization map and
//! the secret vault were process globals, so every caller reached them by
//! calling a free function. `tinymcp` owns them instead — a library that
//! installed globals would make two hosts in one process share connections, and
//! would make its own tests order-dependent. So one instance lives here, and
//! the free functions callers used become methods on it.
//!
//! # It is initialised once, at boot
//!
//! [`init`] is called from the core startup path, before anything that might
//! reach for a server. A caller that arrives before then gets `None` rather
//! than a lazily-built service on a configuration nobody chose.
//!
//! # The proxy decision is made here
//!
//! `tinymcp` takes an already-resolved proxy rather than a policy: whether a
//! proxy applies to a given service is decided by this application's scope
//! setting, its per-service list and its no-proxy list, and all three live
//! here. [`proxy_for_mcp`] consults them and hands over the answer.
